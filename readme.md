# Clash Royale Bot
A friend and I keep seeing people on YouTube creating reinforcement learning agents to play Clash Royale - and they all suck. As such, we decided to have a competition between us to make the best agent.

As of now, I have only spent a few days recreating the game (a feat I am rather proud of) to allow much faster simulations for training (~200ms per game). All of the AI will be coming soon...
